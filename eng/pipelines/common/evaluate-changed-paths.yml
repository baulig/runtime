# This file is intended to evaluate git changes using git based on a include/exclude path filter.
# For more information on how the path evaluation works look at evaluate-changed-paths.sh docs
# at the beginning of that file.
#
# paramters
# subsetName:
#   Name for the subset that we're evaluating changes for.
#   It is required to name the step correctly and so the variable created can be consumable.
# arguments:
#   Array containing the arguments that are to be passed down to evaluate-changed-paths.sh
#   Note that --azurevariable is always set to containschange, no need to pass it down.
